# Switching from EventBlocks to Lua

In Roblox, pretty much all popular games are made professionally with Lua, not EB. This is because EventBlocks is extremely unpractical for making a solid game due to it's flaws, which it has a lot of; and also because block coding in general is essentially impossible to work with when making a real game. There are more reasons, but those are the main ones. The baseline of what I'm trying to say is it's extremely hard to make a decent game in EB, so hard infact that it would probably take years to make in EB what would take a month with Lua. And you'd certainly give up on EB due to it's eventual lag and crashing which makes it completely unusable. EB was designed to be easy, not practical.

Therefore; if you'd like to create a solid game that takes less time and less work at the expense of some of your time every day, you would need to learn Lua. However, learning Lua is much much harder than learning EB as it is a text based language, so you have to deal with A. more debugging, B. more learning, and much more hardships that block coding was made to solve. This does not mean Lua is not worth it to learn over EB, as I believe it 100% definitely, CERTAINLY is worth it to learn over EB.

That's coming from me, with 4 years of experience in Lua and some nice large scale projects made. So, if you want to start now, here are some resources, guides and tips.

## **Learning Lua**

Lua is different than Roblox's version of Lua (which is called Luau), you do not have to learn Lua to learn Luau (feel free to skip to the next section) although it is very helpful when trying to navigate Luau and I recommend it. Lua doesn't have Roblox's 3D system with instances (objects like Parts and stuff) and Roblox's Lua, again Luau is simply an extension of Lua.

[Programming in Lua 5.1](https://doc.lagout.org/programmation/Lua/Programming%20in%20Lua.pdf) (Lua 5.1 is the version of Lua that Luau extends on)

*This is a book, meaning it has extensive reading and not much coding. If you don't like that and want to code, consider a different option with less reading.*

[Lua Manual in 5.1](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/) (Extremely extensive and full documentation on Lua 5.1; again this requires an insane amount of reading, this is mostly just to refer back to when you wanna know something, not to read in one sitting)

[Pgl-yoyo Lua](https://pgl.yoyo.org/luai/i/_) (Extensive Lua documentation, also requires a lot of reading.)

[Lua-users wiki](http://lua-users.org/wiki/) (Biggest documentation out of all of these; community maintained and pretty much has everything in the language, if you don't care that you have to read a lot, this shows you like 99% of the language.)

[Tutorials-point Lua](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lua/index.htm) (I think it's interactive which is nice)

*Not much reading and very good tutorials, recommend if you are a complete beginner to programming and also do not like reading very much.*

[Lua-users *Lua in 8 pages or less*](http://lua-users.org/files/wiki_insecure/users/thomasl/luarefv51single.pdf)

*If you have decent programming knowledge and you absolutely despise reading, here's one you can read in 5 minutes that covers most of the language.*

## **Learning Roblox Lua/Luau**

Read the Lua section for information on what Luau is.

[Roblox Luau official documentation](https://create.roblox.com/docs#Scripting)

*This has every single Roblox instances, it's properties, events, and methods, snippets on how to use them, and separate articles solely for tutorials. This, is what to search on when you need to know something.*

[Roblox DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/c/resources/71)

*You can ask, answer and get the answers to questions here, along with get scripting resources. The DevForum is the next place you go when you need to know something.*

[PeasFactory beginner tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3dbJXSa12Q&list=PLXX6hhg4CysYf0M-_GtCEOgGlkBfrXsoJ)

[PeasFactory """advanced""" tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRS255_y8rM&list=PLXX6hhg4CysbJWPZTFBxCxutohhKNrHKU) (This isn't really advanced.)

[TheDevKing tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDevKing/playlists)

[Okeanskiy tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCch5yE-sVvh4OPB0kOxsGVg)

*These are all community YouTubers, a lot of people don't like AlvinBlox, and PeasFactory's tutorials are REALLY old. But in my opinion, his are the simplest and easiest to digest.*

*Just because it's made by Roblox doesn't mean it's the best..*

## **Help**

[ScriptingHelpers](https://scriptinghelpers.org/) (Their Discord is on the website)

*A place to easily ask and answer questions with no requirements. Their Discord is also good.*

[DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/c/help-and-feedback/54)

*I already talked about this in the Learning Luau category.*

[HiddenDevs](https://hiddendevelopers.com/)

*Discord is on their website again.*

## **Final Words**
Learning programming is hard, it really is. And you might get discouraged. But a true programmer finds fun in it. A true programmer never gives up. I think I'm a true programmer. But I still get bored, I just keep on moving.. if you get discouraged, keep on going.

## TLDR
If you were too lazy to read this, you will be too lazy to learn Lua. It's the hard truth.
